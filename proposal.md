## Comparing Purchasing Parity Index of several countries using informal methods

Purchasing power parity(PPP) is a metric used through out the world to compare the economic situation of different countries. However, PPP is not entirely accurate as it does not give a proper idea of the real purchasing power. To understand this better, The economist prepared the Big Mac index in 1986. It compares the prices of the Big mac in all the countries it is sold. Because of the efficiency and money control with which McDonaldâ€™s restaurants work, the comparative price of Big Mac can be used as a metric to find the relative purchasing power of the countries.

There are other informal ways to find PPP, such as Apple indices which compares the purchasing power with cost of similar apple products. Netflix subscription price compares the price to obtain a Netflix subscription. 

In this paper I will try to compare the most popular PPP indices and their accuracy. For example, using price of apple products to do PPP might sound like a good solution, but its far from accurate as apple products are manufactured in just one country that is China and also the import taxes on apple products are very different depending upon the country.
