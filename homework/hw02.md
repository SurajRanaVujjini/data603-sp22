# Problems with data management and their solutions

## Data lake and Lakehouse

Data lake is a large storage unit which contains huge amounts of data in their original raw format. The data stored in this manner is useful for data analytics purposes. They are also known for their low cost and also their ability to scale according to the client’s need. Though they have a lot of benefits that are leveraged by the enterprises today, they pose certain challenges like performance bottlenecks, bleak security, and reliability issues.

Lakehouse is pretty much a solution to all of these problems. Lakehouse has an additional transactional storage layer and runs all the data structures and data management features on the cloud data lakes. This enables a wide range of opportunities for the businesses by opening them up to advance machine learning and AI capabilities. Many companies are using Delta Lake to build lake houses, which in itself is an open format data management and governance layer that combines the best of both worlds.

## Non-Relational Database management systems

For years now, RDBMS has been the traditional way of storing the data. While major share of data on the internet is handled by the relational database management systems, alternative data models like non-relational database models are being used because of their unique advantages. This can also be due to some of the disadvantage of RDBMS, like the difficulty of horizontal scaling. And due to the fact that relational database management systems were created with structured data in mind, the rise of internet saw a rise in unstructured data like email, photos, videos, etc. and an upgrade from RDBMS was due to properly manage this data. These new non relational databse mdoels are call NoSQL databases.

NoSQL is a word used to describe a database that does not employ the relational model. It’s termed as No SQL as it does not use SQL for managing the data. These databases aim for eventual consistency in ewhich the new data is available after a few milliseconds.

### Examples of NoSQL databases:

**Key value** databases are the ones which store data in the form of arrays in which each array has a key that serves as an identifier. The data from this database can be retrieved using the key. 

**Columnar** databases are the ones that store data in the form of columns. Each of these columns are stored separately instead of grouping together to form a table (RDMBS).

**Document oriented** databases are the databases that store the data in the form of documents. Each of these documents have a unique identifier using which the data can be retrieved. It is similar to a key value database, but the document-oriented databases have metadata of the data that is stored in them. 

**Graph Databases** are similar to document-oriented databases, both of them store the data in the form of documents. But graph databases don’t have metadata on the data that they store, instead all the individual documents in this database are linked together.
