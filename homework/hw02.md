# Problems with data management and their solutions

## Data lake and Lakehouse

Data lake is a large storage unit which contains huge amounts of data in their original raw format. The data stored in this manner is useful for data analytics purposes. They are also known for their low cost and also their ability to scale according to the client’s need. Though they have a lot of benefits that are leveraged by the enterprises today, they pose certain challenges like performance bottlenecks, bleak security, and reliability issues.

Lakehouse is pretty much a solution to all of these problems. Lakehouse has an additional transactional storage layer and runs all the data structures and data management features on the cloud data lakes. This enables a wide range of opportunities for the businesses by opening the up to advance machine learning and AI capabilities. 

## Non-Relational Database management systems

For years now, RMDS has been the traditional way of storing the data. While major share of data on the internet is handled by the relational database management systems, alternative data models like non-relational database models have been popping up with their unique advantages. Those databases are called as NoSQL databases.
NoSQL is a word used to describe a database that does not employ the relational model. It’s termed as No SQL as it does not use SQL for managing the data. These databases aim for eventual consistency where the new data is available after a few milliseconds. Some of the examples of NoSQL databases are Redis, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4j, etc.
